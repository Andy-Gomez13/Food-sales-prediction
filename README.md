# Food_Item_Sales_Final
In this repository you will discover my analysis and graphical representation of a particular set of data. This data demonstrates different sales for food items sold at various stores. 

Furthermore, you will find the code I used to clean the data as well as how I prepared the data for diffrent types of analysis. I ran different visual graphs (histogram, boxplots) to demostrate some aspect of the data. I also used different machine learning techniques to try to determine which method (KNN, Regression, Random Forest) would provide a better model for prediction. 

Below are a couple of the graphs I used to help display the data along with a short video presentation of my findings.
